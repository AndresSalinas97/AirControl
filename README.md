# AirControl Java Swing App Interface

**Final Project for the Interactive Systems course.**

Interface of a mobile app to control air conditioning systems implemented with Java Swing.

Various prototypes of the interface were made prior to implementation using [Pencil Project](https://pencil.evolus.vn). The final one is available [here](https://andressalinas97.github.io/AirControl-Java-Swing-App-Interface/pencil-prototype/#s0_home_page). It actually came out pretty similar :D
